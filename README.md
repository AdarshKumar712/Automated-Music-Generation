# Automated-Music-Generation
A collection of different Model Architectures for Music Generation. These include LSTMs, GRUs, BiGRUs, Attention based Models and Transformers for genenration of Music in its Symbolic Representation, i.e. MIDI Based representation. 

# About the Repo:
This repo is a case study of various Algorithms for music Generation, where the models are present as `.ipynb` Notebooks which can run in Google Colab. Certain example results from the training has also been uploaded to the repository.
